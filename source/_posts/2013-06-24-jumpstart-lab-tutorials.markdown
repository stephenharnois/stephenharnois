Today I found a very interesting and fun tutorial series on [Jumpstart Lab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/).
These tutorials focus mainly on Ruby and Rails, but there is also some Javascript tutorials.
I completed several of the tutorials so far and I think they are structured very well.
The projects are designed more like a project would be given from a customer.
Where you are just given an over all idea of what the client wants and you have to find a solution.
The tutorial then walks you through the process of coming up with a solution.
However they do not give you ever single step they point you towards a solution and allow you to discover the solution on your own.
Then after a rough solution is found they refactor the solution to take advantage of the power of Ruby.
This series is fun and I look forward to completing more of the sections.
