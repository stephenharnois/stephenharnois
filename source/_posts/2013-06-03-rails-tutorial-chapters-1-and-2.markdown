A week ago I started the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial Book](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book).
I found the information in the first two chapters very helpful to get a general idea  of Ruby on Rails.
Before I get to that I should start by describing my exposure to Ruby before this tutorial.

<!-- more -->

##Ruby
I started learning Ruby using the [Codecademy's](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) Ruby track.
The ten chapters covered everything from a basic introduction through more advanced Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
Some of the Challenges where challenging but working through them helped me to better understand Ruby.

##Rails
Once I had a grasp of the Ruby language I moved on to the [Rails for Zombies Course](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies-redux) at the Code School.
That course gave a general overview of the components that are part of a Rails project.

##Ruby on Rails Tutorial Book
After understanding the basics of a Rails app.
I decided to move on to the Ruby on Rails Tutorial Book.
I found the first couple of chapters a great refresher of the previous courses I had taken.
With the addition of showing how to put the project under version control using Git and showing you how to push a demo app to Heroku.
These chapters where very beneficial in helping me cement the Ruby on Rails app building process.

That is all for today I will cover Chapter 3 tomorrow.
