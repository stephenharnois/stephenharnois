Today I did some more fundamental HTML and CSS training. I found a good series on [Codecademy.com](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)
The series covers the fundamentals of web design. This training was a good refresher and helped me learn some of the new HTML 5 methods for entering HTML.
I found the projects fun and interesting and I look forward to the next set of tutorials about Javascript.
