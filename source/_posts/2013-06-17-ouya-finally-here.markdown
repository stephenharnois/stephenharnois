About a year ago I sponsored a [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/) project to bring an open source game console to market.
The project was successfully funded and the Ouya was shipped a week ago.
This weekend when the box arrived I took some time to take photos of the unboxing.
I hope you enjoy!

I can't wait to make some games and play them on this new system.
