Chapters 3 and 4 were about the creation of static pages and ruby data structures used in rails.
This section was a good introduction to static pages in rails and a good refresher of ruby.

##Static Pages and Test-Driven Development
The new idea that I learned from this chapter was to right test first and then code the solution.
This chapter sets up RSpec and introduces the Red, Green, Re-factor procedure.
Red is when you first write a failing test. Green is once you implement a solution.
Re-factoring is going back over the solution and seeing if there is a better solution to the problem.
The good thing is since there is a automated test setup you can see if your change breaks anything else.
At the end of this chapter the advanced setup added Guard and Spork to RSpec which is used to automatically rerun your tests when your files change.

##Rails Flavored Ruby
This chapter was more of a refresher since I had all of the previous training in Ruby.
There was also some information about how Rails includes CSS in the projects.
The exercises at the end of the chapter also suggests looking at the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/), which I will move on to once I am done with this tutorial.

Thats it for today, the chapters get harder from here on so I will cover chapter 5 tomorrow.
