I thought I would take a quick break from all of the Ruby tutorials and learn a CSS framework.
Twitter has created a framework called Bootstrap that can be used to create page layouts by defining divs with predefined classes.
I found a tutorial on [Web Design](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/twitter-bootstrap-101/) section of Tuts +.
This tutorial was short but very informative.
The main thing I took away was that I need more customization and control over the CSS than is allowed by Bootstrap.
I can see the uses of this framework, but I think it can not replace hand coding CSS.
