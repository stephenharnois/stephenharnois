The [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) tutorial is different from most tutorial because you use the language you are learning to run the tutorial.
Most of the challenges were review from previous Ruby tutorials I have taken.
There were several projects included in the Ruby Koans that were very difficult.
The are a lot of good descriptions of the projects on Stack Overflow if you get stuck.
Overall this was a very good tutorial and I learned a lot.

Up next is more classes from [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com/paths/ruby).
See you next time.
